# Turtle Physics Engine

Because who needs Unity when you have turtles?

## Overview

This is a simple physics engine built using Python's `turtle` module. It simulates basic Newtonian physics, including gravity, collision detection, and user interaction. Create and manipulate objects in a 2D space and watch them interact realistically.

## Features

- **Multiple Shapes**: Create circles, squares, and triangles with random sizes and colors.
- **Gravity and Collision**: Objects are affected by gravity and can collide with each other and the boundaries.
- **Gravity Wells**: Introduce gravity wells that attract nearby objects.
- **User Interaction**: Click to create objects, drag to move them, and use keyboard controls for various actions.
- **Customizable**: Adjust gravity and other parameters to change the simulation behavior.

## Controls

- **Click**: Create a new shape at the clicked position.
- **Drag**: Click and drag shapes to move them.
- **G Key**: Create a gravity well at a random location.
- **C Key**: Clear all shapes and gravity wells from the screen.
- **Up Arrow**: Increase gravity (objects fall faster).
- **Down Arrow**: Decrease gravity (objects fall slower).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/24BS/Turtle_Physics_Engine.git
